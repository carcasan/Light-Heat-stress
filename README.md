# Light-Heat-stress

The scripts 'Heat-stress-Experiments' and 'Environmental_data' run the statistical analysis and produce the figures displayed in the paper: 'The importance of light on coral photosynthetic responses to acute heat stress'. Raw data from acute-stress experiments and that collected in the field has been summarised in the files 'Experimental_Tables' and 'Environmental', respectively.
